# Simplifying Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening

## Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental
disorder that is associated with challenges in communication, social
interaction, and repetitive behavior patterns. It is preferred it is
diagnosed at an early stage, to understand how to help the child.
Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and
procedures are not cost effective. This project focuses on
understanding which behavioral aspect is indicative of ASD for
toddlers and would advise a formal clinical diagnosis.

## Goal
This poster presentation aims to solve the above and identify the important characteristics and characteristic groups for ASD screening for toddlers, children and adults.

## DataSet
The dataset was developed by Dr. Fadi Fayez Thabtah to screen
Autism Spectrum Disorders. The dataset contains 10 questions about
behavioral features and a few demographic characteristics.The dataset was developed for four age groups:
i. Toddlers
ii. Children
iii. Teenagers
iv. Adults
Although the analysis has been conducted using all the datasets, the primary focus has been on **toddlers**.

## Navigation Tips
*This repository contains the code along with the exploratory data analysis and statistical analysis in the file named 'code'. The data used to create this code can be found in the 'data' folder. Please note that 4 datasets have been used and further explanation can be found in the code and poster presentation.
Finally the poster presentation is stored using the filename 'poster'.*
